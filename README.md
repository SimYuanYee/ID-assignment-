# ID-assignment-
This project is portfolio of myself and would allow people to view my profile and scout me out if they wish to 

Design Process
---------------------
This is the wireframe for the project
https://github.com/SimYuanYee/ID-assignment-/blob/ecf0c6d5b60653337e2c165dd0b88a1577c7064b/ID%20S10223621F%20Sim%20Yuan%20Yee%20Wireframe.xd

When designing the wireframe, i considered multiple devices, when viewing it on a computer, the text should fit the netire width, while viewing on a mobile phone, the size should also fit its entire width. I decided to use multiple html pages so it would avoid making one page too lengthy and alot to read, it would seperate the sections so viewers have an idea on what each page main purpose is. As a result i decided to create 5 html pages and provide links at the bottom of the page for people ro use to proceed with the next page or previous page. The final page has a submit button which takes users to a thank you message 

This website main purpose is a portfolio of myself and giving an insight of me, as such the main audience of this website 
are interviewers and people who are scouting potential new workers.  They can use this website to learn more about me and if they wish, they can contact me to discuss further. This prooject is the bets way to help them as it provides all the info of myself. 

As a interviewee, I want to use this website to scout for this person etc 

Features
--------------------

Feature 1- Allow users to click on links at the bottom of the page to proceed to the next page

Technolgies Used

I first used repl.it to code it since it also provided a preview, it allow me see any changes and check if there are any erroes 
in my code. I then copied all the code to Visual Studio Code and linked it to GitHub
