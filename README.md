# ID-assignment-
This project is portfolio of myself and would allow people to view my profile and scout me out if they wish to 

Design Process
---------------------
This is the wireframe for the project
https://github.com/SimYuanYee/ID-assignment-/blob/ecf0c6d5b60653337e2c165dd0b88a1577c7064b/ID%20S10223621F%20Sim%20Yuan%20Yee%20Wireframe.xd

When designing the wireframe, i considered multiple devices, when viewing it on a computer, the text should fit the netire width, while viewing on a mobile phone, the size should also fit its entire width. I decided to use multiple html pages so it would avoid making one page too lengthy and alot to read, it would seperate the sections so viewers have an idea on what each page main purpose is. As a result i decided to create 5 html pages and provide links at the bottom of the page for people ro use to proceed with the next page or previous page. The final page has a submit button which takes users to a thank you message 

This website main purpose is a portfolio of myself and giving an insight of me, as such the main audience of this website 
are interviewers and people who are scouting potential new workers.  They can use this website to learn more about me and if they wish, they can contact me to discuss further. This prooject is the bets way to help them as it provides all the info of myself. 

As a interviewee, I want to use this website to scout for this person etc 

From Research I found that Open Sans for the header and Roboto for the text was a good combination due to the crisp and legible style https://www.quicksprout.com/best-font-for-website/, I also found that 24 to 26 pixels being the most popular choice font size for heading so I also went with that https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/typographic-design-survey-best-practices-from-the-best-blogs/#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20the%20choice%20of%20headline%20font%20size,average%20font%20size%20for%20headings%20is%2025.6%20pixels. I also made the font size for the paragraphs 16px as i found that is the ideal size https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-recommended-font-size-of-headings-and-subheadings-for-a-website.

Technolgies Used
-------------------
1.Visual Studio Code
2.Github
3.Adobe XD
4.CSS

I first used Adobe XD to create my wireframe. I then used Visual Studio Code to code it and linked it to GitHub. I also put all my styles in a seperate CSS file 

Testing
-----------------
During Testing, i discovered very few errors with my code, one of the errors i discovered was the first page in that the picture and text did not take up the entire width, i also tested multiple deviice using Repl.it and found they all adjusted accordingly 
I also checked the email submit and found it working fine with it requiring an valid email address. When submitted, he thank you message pops up accordingly. When using a phone device, the first page will change from the image and text being placed side by side to the image being placed above the text.
